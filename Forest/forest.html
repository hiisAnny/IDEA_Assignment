      <h3>Design Description</h3>

      <p class="description">
        This project is an emergent design based on the seasoning bushfire happening in Australian eucalyptus
        forests. It visualizes the rapid and wide spread of bushfire and the forest's reseed and gradual recovery after
        fire
        through an automatic cell machine model. The visual result is variable and emerging with the density of forest
        is
        controlled by users.
      </p>

      <p>Detailed rules:</p>
      <ol type="i">
        <li>Tree Growing: An existing growing tree will continue growing if there are either blank land or other growing
          trees within its 50*50 relative range.</li>
        <li>Tree Turned to Burning Status: A growing tree will switch to burning status when there are over 2 burning
          trees within its 50*50 relative range. While a burning tree will continue burning until it disappears under
          the same situation.</li>
        <li>Breed a new tree: When there’s no burning trees within 50*50 relative range of a growing tree, a new tree
          will be bred on an empty spot within this range.</li>
        <li>Reseed of a tree: A tree can be reseed on an empty spot when there’s no burning tree within its 50*50
          relative range.</li>
      </ol>
